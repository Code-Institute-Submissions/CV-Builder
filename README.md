# Cv Builder

## About

This CV builder gives users the tools necessary to create a simple CV and to download it as a PDF document. The goal is to allow the user as much flexbility as possible in how the content is displayed and organized. It allows users to display information in four types of sections:

-   **Info Section** would include the name and two tables of items for various contact information
-   **Listing Section** would be used for listings such as education or work experience
-   **Block Section** would be used to display simple paragraphs of information
-   **Three Column** would be used to list elements in three columns

Sections can be added or removed, as well as individual items within these sections.

Additionally, the cv can be customized using 4 different themes that would change the fonts and colors on the final product:

-   Default
-   Modern
-   Lavender
-   Deco

Any changes made to the cv or its theme can be saved to the browser's local storage to be updated at a later time. Its content can also be reset if a user wishes to restart from scratch.
